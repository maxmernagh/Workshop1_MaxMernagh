    <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
        <p style= "font-family: 'Work Sans', sans serif; font-size: 1em; font-weight: 300;line-height: 2em">
            I was born in London, England, but moved to Jefferson City, Missouri, USA, with my family when I was 4. So I really don't remember my time in England at all, but I plan to visit there a lot more soon.
            Growing up was pretty cool. I studied hard, played soccer, football, baseball, and basketball. Everyone thought I was best at baseball, but I loved basketball so I stuck with it.
            In High School I played for the Jefferson City Jays at Jefferson City High School. It was cool because we were a good team and I had fun with all my teammates.
            I also played AAU which really helped my development. In my final year of high school I was ranked pretty low, but that was fine because everything turned out better than I imagained it.
            I decided to go to Indiana University Bloomington and play for the Indiana Hoosier's. I was roommates with Thomas Bryant who is on the Washington Wizards now.
            I came off the bench for the Hoosier's in my freshman year, but I played good. I focused on defense and I had some really nice plays that year (2015/16).
            In my sophomore year I think I played only 12 games because I tore my ACL after grabbing a rebound, and ended up having to get surgery in New York about a month later.
            After the surgery I decided to just focus on getting prepared for the 2017 NBA Draft, but since I was able to move around much it was pretty difficult, but I got through it. I just watched film of myself and scouted everything
            I did good and bad, and then worked on those things. My body healed pretty fast, but I still wasn't at 100% during the draft.

            I think I could have been drafted higher for sure, but I wouldn't go back and change that.
            After my meeting and workout with the Raptors about a month before the draft, we both had mutual interest with eachother. I love the Raptors front office and the city, and I knew I would learn a lot from all the players and the training staff.
            I'm super hyped that the Raptors drafted me, I love our team. I was still injured when I got drafted, but a few months later at training camp I was finally cleared to play; I was 2 months ahead of schedule for my recovery.
            I signed my rookie contract on November 14th, 2017, and I was really lucky in my rookie year because I was able to be the starting small-forward and I learnt a lot from Kyle, Demar, Freddy, Pascal, and literally everyone else taught me something valuable.

            In my second year we got Kawhi Leonard, and he is a small-forward also, so I came off the bench that year. I'm a team player so I had no issue with that,
            and Kawhi taught me a lot about how to work out how to be better defensively. I trained with him a lot. He's a fun guy for sure.
            I had an emergency appendectomy at the beginning of the playoffs that year as well, which really sucked because I pretty much missed all of our championship run. I was with
            team during the NBA Finals, but didn't play. I still had fun though. I'm proud of they guys for winning the championship, but yah I wish I could have played.
            Celebrating with the team and staff was a moment I'll never forget. The parade was crazy; there was so much people. I was pretty lit to be honest, but not as much as Marc Gasol or Norman Powell.

            I was a starter again in my third year (2019/20) because Kawhi Leonard decided to leave our team. That's fine, he can do what he wants. I was confident we could repeat as NBA Champs without him though.
            The season was going well for us. Pascal and Fred were killing it, and then COVID-19 shut the league down for a few months. Shortly after the league shutdown, we went into lockdown. It was hard to train during the lockdown but
            I tried my best to stay in shape. When we got to the NBA Restart at the Orlando Bubble I was still confident as ever in our team to win the championship, but we lost to the Boston Celtics. I did hit a nasty buzzer-beater over Jaylen Brown
            in Game 3 after being down by 2 games. We ended up going to Game 7, and we could have won the series but Boston just got the better of us.

            I had hit buzzer-beater's before in highschool, so I wasn't surprised that it went in. It was cool though. I wouldn't have been able to hit that shot though if it weren't for my teammates and coaches always encouraging me to shoot.
            I stay cool through moments like that because I always expect to make the play. I don't shoot trying to miss. Thinking about it now though, it was pretty crazy how I was able to get the shot off in 0.3 seconds from 3-point-range.
            I'm happy I was able to do taht for the fans watching all around the world.
            During the off-season I really focused on getting stronger but faster, I didn't want to gain any more weight but I wanted to have more muscle mass and increased stamina and agility.
            In every off-season I focus on the part of my game that needs it most.

            better everyday in practice. I try to share defensive tips with everyone, and I want to become more of a leader for this team. We have accomplished so much already as a young team, and I know we will be champions again soon. That's my life story so far, and I'll share more with everyone
            whenever some more cool stuff happens.
